h2 FAQ
p
  strong> Q: Do you host streams?
  | A: No, we cheat and just link to streams on Picarto since that's where (almost) everyone is already. This is simply a nice way to track streaming artists.
p
  strong> Q: How do I get my stream/a friend's stream/<artist>'s stream here?
  ' A: Send a private message to a site administrator
  ' with a link to the stream and the artist tag if applicable.
